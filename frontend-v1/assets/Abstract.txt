PROJECT OVERVIEW

Bolt is an international ride hailing company that operates in different countries across the globe, including Kenya. Ride hailing applications such as the Bolt application have set measures and security features to ensure the safety of their passengers while on transit. These security features include sharing the ETA (estimated time of arrival) and the use of emergency buttons. However, these security features have glaring gaps that have deemed the application unsafe to use. Further, there have been numerous reports of passengers claiming to have been harassed during the Bolt rides by rogue drivers. In most cases, these drivers are usually blacklisted in other ride hailing applications like Uber.

Unfortunately, these reports usually go unchecked. As a result of this gap, these reports have led to a steep decrease in usage of the Bolt application. While other ride hailing applications like Uber that are more expensive by at least 30% and have stricter security features boast 69%-70% usage in Kenya, Bolt only boasts a low 21%. It is not only a business blow to Bolt, which could have an upper hand in the ride hailing business, but also a testament to the fact that users will pay more for assured security. 

The aim of this project therefore, was to reevaluate the security features of the Bolt application in Kenya, specifically those that are meant to help users stay safe during rides. By reevaluating these features, we were able to identify gaps and propose a solution to curb the security problem. This solution, will not only help users gain agency over their own security during ride hailing, but will also help the Bolt application to find better strategies to help their users regain confidence in using their application.
